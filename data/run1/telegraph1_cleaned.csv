When she was found alive and well in a hotel, after a nationwide search, her private mental anguish became the most public of scandals"
1510,Christie,"🗞️Agatha Christie’s understanding of the press derived, in part, from her first-hand experience of its excesses. 

Here, perhaps, is the strongest connection of all. 

Almost a century ago, Christie was in the eye of a tabloid storm as fierce as the one that now bears her name"

1519,The ongoing trial,"The ongoing trial represents, one would think, an improbable culture clash with the genteel figure of Agatha Christie, whose tea-at-the-vicarage social landscape is one in which chipolatas are merely party sausages, and leaks are found only in drains"
