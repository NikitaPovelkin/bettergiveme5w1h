2022-02-17T16:01:27+00:00,Scientists used more than six decades of death rates from US-based hurricanes to show that feminine-named hurricanes cause significantly more deaths than masculine-named hurricanes. They put this down to a key element – gender-based expectation.
2022-02-17T16:01:27+00:00,"Why? Because people don’t take them as seriously; so don’t take as many precautions to protect themselves, and there are consequently more deaths."
2022-02-17T16:01:26+00:00,"While some people have rightly pointed out that there really isn’t much to be intimidated about by the naming of Storm Dudley, there’s a bank of fascinating psychological research to back up the fact that overall, female-titled storms and hurricanes are in fact far more deadly."
