2022-05-10T22:07:02+00:00,"But for some, absolute disempowerment is appealing as long as they are not the ones being disempowered. 

No one wants to be the exploited body. 

But some people like the idea of being the exploiters."
2022-05-10T22:07:02+00:00,"The idea that the state can use your body for its own purposes is dystopian; it evokes nightmare visions like The Matrix, in which humans spend their lives as helpless thralls of a vampire state, hooked up to machines which drain their energy."
2022-05-10T22:07:02+00:00,"The state can declare certain health care immoral and punish people who try to access it.

 Bodily autonomy doesn’t exist. 

If the government decides that your body is best used as a baby factory, that’s how it will be used, and if you object, you can be thrown in prison."
2022-05-10T22:07:01+00:00,"For Alito, people do not have a right to be free of government interference in fundamental personal sexual or health decisions."
2022-05-10T22:07:00+00:00,"The parallel here with the anti-abortion ideology of forced birth is clear. In the leaked draft opinion which may form the basis for striking down abortion rights, Samuel Alito launches a sweeping attack on the right to privacy."
2022-05-10T22:07:00+00:00,"Alabama House Representative Wes Allen claimed that the law protects children. 

“Their brains are not developed to make the decisions long term about what these medications and surgeries do to their body,” he insisted."
2022-05-10T22:07:00+00:00,"There is a broad consensus among medical professionals that trans youth benefit from gender-affirming care. Trans people often experience dysphoria, or a sense of acute psychological distress, when their sex assigned at birth does not match their gender identity."
2022-05-10T22:06:59+00:00,"The Alabama bill, signed into law by Governor Kay Ivey this week, makes it a felony for doctors to prescribe puberty blockers, hormones, or surgery to trans people under the age of 19."
2022-05-10T22:06:59+00:00,"But the attack on trans people and the attack on pregnant people are both part of the same Christian theocratic authoritarian weaponization of health care. 

It needs to be opposed everywhere, or reactionaries will build power and hatred to use against everyone."
2022-05-10T22:06:59+00:00,"Discussion of this escalation of state violence and tyranny has been muted because politicians and activists have mostly been focused on the Supreme Court’s sweeping, horrifying threat to gut abortion rights."
2022-05-10T22:06:58+00:00,This weekend Alabama passed a brutally cruel law criminalizing health care for transgender youth.

2022-05-10T20:05:46+00:00,Read the full report here ⤵️
2022-05-10T20:05:46+00:00,"“It is a victory, and it also poses the more difficult question about what’s next,” Florida State University College of Law professor Mary Ziegler told @Independent"
2022-05-10T20:05:45+00:00,"Should the ruling be finalised, it will be seen as a crowning achievement for a minority movement that has spent the last several decades focused on Roe’s demise, despite growing consensus among Americans in support of protecting abortion access."
2022-05-10T20:05:44+00:00,The so-called “pro-life” movement – parallel to and in concert with a growing Christian right and conservative legal groups – has fuelled the Republican Party and waged a campaign to inform “single issue” voters into a powerful base.
2022-05-10T20:05:43+00:00,A draft opinion signalling the end of constitutionally protected abortion access in America marks a victory for an anti-abortion movement that has reshaped right-wing politics and helped Republicans stack the federal judiciary with ideologically like-minded figures.
2022-05-10T20:05:42+00:00,But getting a case like Mississippi’s in front of a conservative-majority Supreme Court to directly challenge legal abortion has been central to a campaign that was years in the making.
2022-05-10T20:05:42+00:00,"A lot can happen within a year. Longtime liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died. Donald Trump named her replacement Amy Coney Barrett, who was confirmed to the Senate in record time before Mr Trump left office."
2022-05-10T20:05:41+00:00,"One year later, the state’s argument hinged on the question of ending Roe, rejecting precedent that could end constitutional protections for abortion and trigger a wave of laws that make it illegal in more than half the country."
2022-05-10T20:05:40+00:00,"When lawyers for the state of Mississippi defended a state law banning abortion at 15 weeks of pregnancy before the US Supreme Court in 2020, they suggested that the court did not need to overturn Roe v Wade to do so."
