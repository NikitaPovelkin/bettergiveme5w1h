2022-05-13T10:57:45+00:00,"🗞️Agatha Christie’s understanding of the press derived, in part, from her first-hand experience of its excesses. 

Here, perhaps, is the strongest connection of all. 

Almost a century ago, Christie was in the eye of a tabloid storm as fierce as the one that now bears her name"
2022-05-13T10:57:43+00:00,"📖Coleen Rooney’s scheme to identify, by a process of elimination, the author of the anonymous leaks is somewhat reminiscent of Christie’s 1943 novel, The Moving Finger.

The novel centres upon similar attempts to trace the source of a series of scurrilous anonymous letters"
2022-05-13T10:57:42+00:00,"📚As for the  plot  aspect of the Wagatha saga – this, too, would surely have appealed. 

There is even a vital missing clue, the phone belonging to Rebekah Vardy’s agent – also in the frame as a source of newspaper stories – which now lies somewhere in the North Sea"
2022-05-13T10:57:40+00:00,"💷Christie herself grew up with little money, her amiable gentlemanly father having squandered most of it. 

She understood, always, the urgent need to acquire security – understood, too, that there are many ways of earning it"
2022-05-13T10:57:39+00:00,"She would certainly have  got  Coleen Rooney, the bright daughter of a Liverpool bricklayer who now lives in a £4 million mansion.

Her books feature feisty girls full of wit, such as the heroine of The Sittaford Mystery who stops at nothing to save her boyfriend from the gallows"
2022-05-13T10:57:39+00:00,"📱Of course Christie would have loathed the contemporary trappings of this case, especially the ugly idiocies of social media (she never even enjoyed television).

Yet she moved with the times far more than is generally realised"
2022-05-13T10:57:38+00:00,"🔎 Christie was a student of human nature, of motivation, and in essence that is what the Rooney-Vardy showdown is all about.

Two women, watched with who knows what feelings by their husbands, locking balayaged ponytails and refusing to back down"
2022-05-13T10:57:35+00:00,"🗨️ One of her last known remarks, before her death in January 1976, was:  I wonder what has happened to Lord Lucan?  

Like most of us, she was fascinated by these real-life stories – not least because her job required her to be"
2022-05-13T10:57:35+00:00,"➡️However, that pervasive view of Christie does not quite square with the reality. 

The real Agatha Christie – although a product of the upper-middle class into which she was born in 1890 – was, in truth, a supremely unshockable cosmopolitan"
2022-05-13T10:57:34+00:00,"The ongoing trial represents, one would think, an improbable culture clash with the genteel figure of Agatha Christie, whose tea-at-the-vicarage social landscape is one in which chipolatas are merely party sausages, and leaks are found only in drains"
2022-05-13T10:57:33+00:00,"🔎The  Wagatha  epithet was conjured on Twitter (where else?)

It was created in tribute to the deductive powers of Mrs Rooney, who – by deliberate deployment of fake stories on her Instagram  – alighted upon Mrs Vardy, who denies the accusation, as the source of tabloid leaks"
2022-05-13T10:57:32+00:00,"🕵️‍♀️The  Wagatha Christie  portmanteau is a headline, a hashtag, a phrase with a crazed life of its own. 

❓But what would Dame Agatha Christie have thought of the court battle between Rebekah Vardy and Coleen Rooney?
