The deal could be announced as early as Monday, according to reports. You can follow all the latest right here ⬇️"
2022-04-25T17:55:36+00:00,"🔴 How might Elon Musk remake Twitter?

By saying Twitter is not living up to its potential to be a “platform for free speech,” he seems to be saying he would scale back content moderation. This could see a return for those banned by Twitter, potentially even seeing Trump."
2022-04-25T17:55:36+00:00,"🔴 Where will Elon Musk get the funds to buy Twitter from?

He claims to have significant crypto holdings, mostly bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH) and some Dogecoin, but he also says he plans to “HODL” and not sell his cryptocurrency."
2022-04-25T17:55:36+00:00,"🔴 Why is Elon Musk interested in Twitter? 

Ostensibly because the service, he says, isn't living up to its potential as a “platform for free speech.”

Musk has described himself as a “free speech absolutist"" — but he has blocked Twitter users who question or disagree with him."
2022-04-25T17:55:35+00:00,"His offer, which looks set to get the green light on Monday, raises as many questions as it answers.

Among them: Why does he want to take it over? Where’s the money coming from? Would a sale make shareholders happy? And what would the social platform look like if he succeeds?"
2022-04-25T17:55:35+00:00,The world’s richest person – and eighth most popular Twitter user – plans to make the platform fully private in order to restore its commitment to what he terms “free speech.”
