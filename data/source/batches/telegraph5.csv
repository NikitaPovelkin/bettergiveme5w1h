2022-06-11T11:20:41+00:00,"❓Was it done elsewhere, or by someone else, possibly for some symbolic reason, perhaps even linked with the Masonic lodge he was involved with?

Sometimes the lodge was called Propaganda Due or P2, at other times i frati neri, the black friars’…"
2022-06-11T11:20:40+00:00,"➡️ And there was another question Gallop was unable to answer: Calvi had always had a moustache, yet his face had been clean-shaven"
2022-06-11T11:20:40+00:00,"🗣  What I discovered was that, with the tide ebbing – as it was at the time when Calvi seemed likely to have been suspended from the rope – it would have been relatively straightforward to bring a vessel in on the same side of the scaffolding as the body was found,  Gallop says"
2022-06-11T11:20:38+00:00,"➡️ With the murder routes, Calvi could have been transported to the bridge – incapacitated or even dead – either in a car, in which case he could have been carried to the towpath then down the ladder on to the scaffolding, or lowered on to it over the river wall; or by boat"
2022-06-11T11:20:38+00:00,"🔴 Next, Gallop turned her attention to the two most likely murder routes’.

 I treated as open the question of whether he could have been incapacitated, or even dead, before he was brought to the scaffolding,  she writes"
2022-06-11T11:20:36+00:00,➡️ What became apparent was that the two possible suicide routes’ to reach the scaffolding were both highly implausible
2022-06-11T11:20:36+00:00,"✍️ Gallop writes:  This reconstruction showed me how hard it would have been for an unfit 62-year-old man to reach the place on the scaffolding where Calvi’s body was found, all on his own – with broken bricks in his pockets and in the crotch of his trousers"
2022-06-11T11:20:36+00:00,"➡️  So I arranged to have it erected in my garden and persuaded my husband, Russell – who is roughly the same build as Calvi  – to dress up in some clothing that the Calvi family had provided,  Gallop adds."
2022-06-11T11:20:35+00:00,"✍️ Gallop writes:  To determine how he died, I had to work out whether it was possible for Calvi to have climbed on to the scaffolding unassisted"
2022-06-11T11:20:34+00:00,"💬 My first piece of good fortune in the investigation came with the scaffolding,  writes Gallop.

 In some cold cases I have worked on, important items have been lost, but amazingly, the scaffolding had been kept intact by the firm that erected it"

 The visit was useful in a general sense, but unsurprisingly there was nothing specific to learn there"
2022-06-11T11:20:31+00:00,"🔎There had been very little crime-scene-type investigation.

All Gallop had to work on was a few paltry pieces of evidence: including the jacket, trousers and shoes he had been wearing; the rope from around his neck; and the broken pieces of brick that had been in his pockets"
2022-06-11T11:20:30+00:00,"➡️ A decade later, the Calvi family approached Angela Gallop.

What they wanted above all was closure around the question of whether he had killed himself (as a first London inquest had concluded) or been murdered in a way that was designed to look like suicide"
2022-06-11T11:20:29+00:00,"🔴 The police had almost immediately decided Calvi’s death was suicide.

His family, however, instinctively rejected the notion that such a devout Catholic as Roberto Calvi would ever have taken his own life, since suicide is considered a mortal sin in traditional Catholicism"
