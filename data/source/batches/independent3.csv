2022-03-31T15:50:33+00:00,"""This isn't to prove that trans women can't be great athletes, or win, or even dominate. It is to prove that people are lying to you in order to turn you against trans women athletes,"" said Schuyler Bailar, the first openly trans swimmer in the NCAA men’s first division."
2022-03-31T15:50:33+00:00,"Yet numbers can only tell us so much. 

Trans advocates argue that even if trans women were winning more competitions, that would not prove they had an unfair advantage, nor would it justify their exclusion from women's events."
2022-03-31T15:50:32+00:00,"These statistics seem largely in line with those of trans athletes across the world. 

Although trans women have been allowed to compete in women's Olympics since 2004, none have won a medal."

🔴 Thomas won her race – but didn’t break records

🔴 Her swimming times are on par with cis women"
2022-03-31T15:50:32+00:00,"Yet in all this, there has been scant detail about how Ms Thomas's performance actually compares to other women at her level. 

@Independent crunched the numbers – and found little evidence that she poses any threat to women's sport."
2022-03-31T15:50:31+00:00,"Florida's Republican governor Ron DeSantis, who last year approved legislation banning trans women from high school and college women's sports, even signed a proclamation on Tuesday declaring 500-yard runner-up Emma Weyant the ""rightful winner""."
2022-03-31T15:50:30+00:00,"Amid her success, though, Ms Thomas has become a lightning rod in the debate about trans women in sport, as well as a target for much of the American right."
2022-03-31T15:50:30+00:00,"On 17 March, Lia Thomas became the first openly transgender athlete to win America's top trophy in university sports when she swam to victory in the women's 500 yard (457 meter) freestyle race."
