2022-06-22T17:43:04+00:00,"Even if just in a small way, he hopes his humour and observations on the parody sites ”continue to be entertaining for people.

“If it brings a few people to the polls, then fantastic,” Mr Morton says. “I would love it if more people would come out because of them.”"
2022-06-22T17:43:04+00:00,"Since then, other politicians Mr Morton’s created parody sites for include Republicans Gov. Abbott; Elise Stefanik; Lauren Boebert; Kevin McCarthy; Jim Jordan; Matt Gaetz; and Marco Rubio."
2022-06-22T17:43:03+00:00,"“And at the same time, I thought, man, he could’ve had a lot more fun with that. But he’s in politics, so he probably couldn’t ... I decided, oh, what kind of idiot would not grab their domain?”

More than a few politicians, he quickly found out."
2022-06-22T17:43:03+00:00,"He adds: “Around that time, I saw that there was a politician, some guy in ... some small town, where he had purchased a domain of his opponent and had that domain redirected to his own - and I thought that was super clever."
2022-06-22T17:43:01+00:00,"All of this from a 51-year-old comedian who’d barely even used his Twitter account until 2019.

That’s when Toby Morton, who’s written for shows like South Park and MadTV, began turning his satirical eye to the political turmoil spiralling in the US."
2022-06-22T17:43:01+00:00,"He’s been shouted at on the street by Rep Lauren Boebert in her stronghold of Rifle, Colorado. He’s got the personal email of a high-level staffer for the Texas governor because a woman answering the office phones mistook him for an employee."
