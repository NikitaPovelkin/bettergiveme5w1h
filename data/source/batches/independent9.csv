2022-04-06T21:17:15+00:00,🔗 Read the full exclusive story here
2022-04-06T21:17:15+00:00,Authorities released this timeline showing the criminal history of accused I-65 killer Harry Edward Greenwell
2022-04-06T21:17:14+00:00,This sketch was the only clue for decades until DNA evidence linked Greenwell to the crimes.
2022-04-06T21:17:13+00:00,"According to authorities, Greenwell – who was 68 when he died – was identified through genealogical investigation in all three deaths along the Indiana-Kentucky border."
2022-04-06T21:17:13+00:00,"Peggy Gill, Jeanne Gilbert and Vicki Heath were all victims of the I-65, or Days Inn Killer"
2022-04-06T21:17:12+00:00,"When asked about authorities’ suspicion her husband could have more victims, Jenkins said: ""It’s certainly a possibility. When you know what you do about serial killers, they generally don’t just stop."""
2022-04-06T21:17:12+00:00,"“One thing that’s going through my mind is that, I guess, I’m lucky to be alive,” Ms Jenkins, a grandmother now living in Minnesota, tells The Independent."
2022-04-06T21:17:11+00:00,"Julie Jenkins, 73, was married to Greenwell for nearly 20 years - and totally blindsided by the multi-agency press conference Tuesday naming her husband, who died in 2013, as the killer of at least three women along the Kentucky-Indiana border in the late 1980s."

2022-05-04T16:37:54+00:00,"Katrina Axelsson, the founder and CEO of Tastry, said that such was the devastation to the wine industry that she felt compelled to step in."
2022-05-04T16:37:54+00:00,"Following the devastating 2020 fire season, some California wineries requested that grapes be tested for smoke taint before they purchased the fruit. 

But due to how far-reaching the smoke damage is, labs could not keep up with demand."
2022-05-04T16:37:53+00:00,"Chemicals in wildfire smoke can be absorbed through grape skins, concealing their original taste and smell. If these grapes are then crushed into wine, it creates an unpleasant, even nasty taste, ranging from burnt and ashy to medicinal."
2022-05-04T16:37:53+00:00,"Then, 2020. The LNU Lighting Complex, a monster blaze that saw several smaller fires combine, raged across 363,220 acres in wine country for six weeks from late summer into fall, destroying 1,500 buildings and killing six people."
2022-05-04T16:37:53+00:00,"California has the largest US market share, making $43.6bn in 2021. 

In October 2017, a wave of wildfires devastated more than 100,000 acres in Napa and Sonoma counties with the Tubbs Fire becoming the most destructive in the state to date."
2022-05-04T16:37:52+00:00,"This damage, called taint, is a recurring problem for winemakers in the American West, where wildfires are now ripping across the landscape at an unprecedented rate."
2022-05-04T16:37:51+00:00,"In California wine country, there’s a waiting list arguably more prized than the three Michelin-starred French Laundry. 

It exists for a handful of laboratories capable of testing wineries’ smoke-damaged grapes in the wake of wildfires."

2022-05-04T09:40:39+00:00,"Ruth Davison, CEO of women's charity @RefugeCharity told The Independent the language in the article ""bears all the hallmarks of misogyny from a bygone era that privileges male dominance over women in the family, and society at large"""
2022-05-04T09:40:16+00:00,"""In France, the protected position of the middle-aged, semi-skilled male worker makes him an attractive partner... 

""He is, to be blunt, less likely than his British counterpart to be employed flipping hamburgers, wearing a security guard's uniform or changing nappies"""
2022-05-04T09:39:59+00:00,"""The French have, like the original indomitable Gaul, Asterix, defied forces others thought overwhelming by recourse to a potent elixir of masculinity and patriotism. They have, to be blunt, drawn strength from their chauvinisme"""
2022-05-04T09:39:34+00:00,"In the article, Mr Gove argued that government policy should ""nurture and support the traditional male breadwinner"" and praised the French for having protected the ""social, cultural and economic position of the paterfamilias"", or head of the family"
